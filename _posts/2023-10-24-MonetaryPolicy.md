# Monetary Rules

## Instrument-rule-based Monetary Policy

it is common practice to adopt a simple [Taylor](https://www.nber.org/papers/w6754)-type instrument rule to describe monetary policy when estimating DSGE models.This practice is inconsistent with the claim of practitioners, that central bank rather sets clear objectives. [(chen, et al. , 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393217300983?via%3Dihub)


## General Targeting Rule

This general targeting rule is then developed into a specific targeting rule by maximizing these objectives subject to the equations describing the decentralized equilibrium of the economy. The targeting rule that emerges is dependent on **the degree of commitment** the central bank possesses. What that degree of commitment is in practice, and whether or not we can develop data-coherent targeting rules, remains an open question, with the literature containing mixed results.

## Discretion and Commitment

Commitment is the ability to deliver on past promises no matter what the particular current situation is.. Promised behavior is generally contingent on future events. Promises are not typically blanket commitments to be fulfilled irrespective of future situations. The key aspect of commitment is that the policymaker keeps his promise to act in a certain way when a particular future event comes to pass.

Under discretion, a policymaker is allowed to change policy depending on current circumstances and to disregard any past promises. 

Economists refer to the desire to alter previously made plans as the **time-consistency** problem because, at each date, an individual or policymaker finds it tempting to deviate from what an earlier plan dictated. It is people's ability to plan ahead and anticipate the policymaker's actions that makes outcomes under discretion sub-optimal. 

If **prices and wages** are **perfectly flexible**. Anticipated changes to the **money supply have no effect** on output. In this environment, if firms believe the central bank is going to increase the money supply, they respond by increasing prices. Unanticipated changes in money do affect output. If the central bank adopts an expansionary policy by unexpectedly increasing in money stock, output expands and inflation increases. Firms and workers are both surprised by the increase in money and initially do not demand higher peices or higher wages. The increased money stock, which is held by public, can now be used to purchase more goods and aggregate demand subsequently increases. As firms and workers catch on to what has happened, prices and wages increase, resulting in inflation. 

**Under both commitment and discretion, output remains at potential, but commitment achieves this result with lower inflation.**

The discretionary planner, because he makes decisions period by period, makes no promises and, as a result, does not have a similar ability to influence expectations.


## Potential Outcome

the level that would occur in the absence of any economic distortions. Basically, it is the level that would obtain if prices were free to vary, markets were competitive, and there were no distortionary taxes.
