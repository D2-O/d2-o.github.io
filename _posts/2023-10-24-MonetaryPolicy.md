## Instrument-rule-based Monetary Policy

it is common practice to adopt a simple Taylor-type instrument rule to describe monetary policy when estimating DSGE models.This practice is inconsistent with the claim of practitioners, that central bank rather sets clear objectives. 


## General Targeting Rule

This general targeting rule is then developed into a specific targeting rule by maximizing these objectives subject to the equations describing the decentralized equilibrium of the economy. The targeting rule that emerges is dependent on the degree of commitment the central bank possesses. What that degree of commitment is in practice, and whether or not we can develop data-coherent targeting rules, remains an open question, with the literature containing mixed results.
