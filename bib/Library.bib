In an overlapping-generations model with constant growth rate, g, of labor-augmenting productivity, and with shocks to the durability of capital, we show that along a balanced growth path, the maximum sustainable ratio of bonds to capital is attained when the riskfree interest rate, r[sub]f, equals g. Furthermore, this maximal ratio maximizes utility per capita along a balanced growth path and ensures that the economy is dynamically efficient.},

  abstract = {The economic effects of public debt remains one of few subjects that evoke controversy among academics and policy makers, despite being a subject of intense scrutiny for prolonged periods. Earlier literature examined national debt in neoclassical growth models, and focused on its effects on steady state equilibrium. The general finding was that debt issuance by the state reduces factor accumulation in the long run. By the fundamental welfare theorem, the competitive equilibrium is pareto-optimal, and thus, state intervention distorts market-driven outcomes and interferes with optimal allocations in equilibrium. Later research contributions established conditions under which the competitive market environment may reach equilibrium that is not optimal. In this case, the issuance of debt by the government is capable of generating pareto improvements over market equilibrium. Thus far, the theoretical neoclassical literature have limited the positive welfare effect of government debt to the perverse case in which the competitive equilibrium is suboptimal. Recent strands in the literature have explored conditions under which public debt may be invested in infrastructure and other forms of public capital in endogenous growth models. These have been much less rigorous, but have shown that contrary to the result from neoclassical theory, debt issuance for investment may increase equilibrium growth rate in a socially planned economy where the state dictates private saving and consumption decisions. But this is a very restrictive requirement. In addition, even though the recent literature addresses an important aspect of government spending, namely that governments issue debt to provide key infrastructure and public services, no existing work (to best knowledge) has examined the welfare effects of such purposeful government borrowing in a decentralized environment. This dissertation aims to contribute to filling the gap by exploring the effects of debt issuance for investment in public capital using a production structure that is widely used in endogenous growth models, but dispenses with the usual assumptions of a socially planned economy. In other words, we need not require the government to internalize and/or dictate private consumption and savings behaviour for equilibrium to exist. In doing so, a competitive framework is used to examine the role of government debt in a growing economy where public capital is essential to private sector production. We will see first, that the long-run equilibrium of the planning problem elaborated in endogenous growth theory can be supported as competitive equilibrium outcome with lump-sum transfers by government. However, the growth maximizing capital ratio in the planning problem may not yield efficient allocations. Secondly, we will see that in a simple analytic environment, debt-financed public investment can enhance both private wealth and welfare in general equilibrium. This is a novel finding that compares favourably with the Diamond result where debt may increase welfare in the dynamically inefficient equilibrium, but always reduces capital labour ratio in the long-run. Similarly, as opposed to Blanchard result where government expenditure does not benefit individual’s utility but imposes a debt-service burden and hence reduces capital and consumption at steady state, debt-financed public investment directly affects agents utility by increasing not only the prevailing interest rate, but in general the rate of return to investment in the economy. As no known existing work has explored the welfare effects of government expenditure in public capital formation through issuance of debt, this is the crux of my contribution to the literature in this dissertation. The analytic results generally show that debt-financed public expenditure that increases the public capital stock does not only improve efficiency where the equilibrium is sub-optimal, it can increase economic efficiency and welfare of agents in the long-run. The data for a large section of developing and advanced economies seem to check out the necessary condition for debt-financed public investment to be welfare improving. I conclude the research with policy discussions on the implications of the analytic and empirical insights on the future of developing country borrowing in the wake of the high debt levels occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

This finding is based on a model of a large number of infinitely lived households whose saving behavior is influenced by precautionary saving motives and borrowing constraints. This model incorporates a different role for government debt than is found in standard models, and it captures different cost–benefit trade-offs. On the benefit side, government debt enhances the liquidity of households by providing an additional means of smoothing consumption and by effectively loosening borrowing constraints. On the cost side, the implied taxes have adverse wealth distribution and incentive effects. In addition, government debt crowds out capital via higher interest rates and lowers per capita consumption.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the properties of optimal fiscal policy in the long-run and over the business cycle in general equilibrium models with agents that differ with respect to their skills and with production processes embodying capital-skill complementarity. To this end, the thesis is composed of four chapters which asses different aspects of optimal fiscal policy under various specifications incorporating labour skill and production differences as well as different assumptions regarding the policy instruments available to the government. The first two chapters focus on the long-run, while the last two concentrate on business cycle dynamics. The first and third chapters examine setups that allow households to differ with respect to their income and whose position in the labour market with respect to their skill is exogenously determined. In contrast, the second and fourth chapters consider setups where the labour force belongs to a single household, which guarantees consumption irrespective of skill level, and unskilled labour can endogenously acquire skills to become skilled.     Chapter 1 presents a detailed numerical analysis of the effects of optimal fiscal policy in an economy where the households are heterogeneous with respect to their labour and capital income. The production structure is characterised by a CES function allowing for capital, skilled and unskilled labour. In this setup, optimal fiscal policy in the long-run implies a non-zero and positive tax rate on capital income together with highly progressive labour income taxes. Moreover, the level of the optimal tax rate on capital income and the progressivity of labour income taxes are sensitive to the weight placed on the skilled agents in the objective function of the government.     Chapter 2 analyses optimal factor income taxation when there are different returns to skilled and unskilled workers, who belong to the same household, and to capital in structures and equipment, under capital-skill complementarity and endogenous skill acquisition. We find that when all factor inputs are taxed at separate rates, both capital income taxes are zero in the long-run, there is a subsidy to education and labour income taxes are progressive. The progressivity in labour income taxes is reduced if investment in education cannot be subsidised, whereas if the government can only impose a single labour income tax, the tax on income from capital equipment will be non-zero. These results remain valid even if the government is restricted to satisfy a given level of debt to output ratio, although with welfare losses. Finally, we show that the transitional dynamics of the fiscal instruments from the exogenous to optimal taxation are not affected by the restrictions to the fiscal policy menu.     Chapter 3 examines how income taxes are optimally distributed over the business cycle in a model with high, middle and low income households when the government is restricted to balance its budget in each period. The findings of an empirically relevant model indicate that under optimal fiscal policy the income tax rate of the high income households has the lowest volatility and the income tax rate of the low income households exhibits the lowest counter-cyclicality. If the fiscal policy menu also includes a consumption tax, the progressivity of the income tax rates is even higher and the results regarding the volatilities of the income taxes are overturned. We further find that the progressivity of the income tax rates is optimally increased after an output-enhancing shock.     Chapter 4 undertakes a normative investigation of the quantitative properties of optimal tax smoothing in a business cycle model with state contingent debt, capital-skill complementarity, endogenous skill formation and stochastic shocks to public consumption, as well as total factor and capital equipment productivity. We also examine the properties of optimal taxation under a restriction on the debt to output ratio. Our main finding is that, an empirically relevant restriction which does not allow the relative supply of skilled labour to adjust in response to aggregate shocks, significantly changes the cyclical properties of optimal labour taxes. This result remains valid even in the presence of a budget rule that restricts the debt to output ratio. We show that the key to understanding this result is that the government finds it optimal to adjust labour income tax rates to alter the average net returns to skilled and unskilled labour hours.},

  abstract = {In 2009 and 2010, China undertook a 4 trillion Yuan fiscal stimulus, roughly equivalent to 12 percent of annual GDP. The "fiscal" stimulus was largely financed by off-balance sheet companies (local financing vehicles) that borrowed and spent on behalf of local governments. The off-balance sheet financial institutions continued to grow after the stimulus program ended at the end of 2010. After the end of the stimulus program, spending by these off-balance sheet companies accounted for roughly 10\% of GDP each year, with an increasing share used for what are essentially private commercial projects. The off-balance spending by local governments is likely responsible for a 5 percentage-point increase in the aggregate investment rate and part of the 7 to 8 percentage-point decline in current account surplus since 2008. Finally, we argue that local governments used their new access to financial resources to facilitate access to capital to favored private firms, which potentially worsens the overall efficiency of capital allocation. The long run effect of off-balance sheet spending by local governments may be a permanent decline in the growth rate of aggregate productivity and GDP.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) has given a new impulse to research on the interactions between monetary and fiscal policies. The key considerations in this research concern (1) the question of how fiscal policy impacts on the credibility of the common monetary policy and (2) to what extent fiscal policy can or should take over the role of monetary policy in stabilising country-specific shocks.Central bankers often regard fiscal discipline as a prerequisite for a credible monetary policy. Accordingly, the Delors Report (1989), which provides the blueprint for the foundation of a monetary union in Europe, emphasised fiscal discipline as a prerequisite for a successful monetary union. This view has found its way into the Treaty on the European Union (the ‘Maastricht Treaty’), which sets out the institutional framework for EMU. The Treaty includes restrictions on deficit and debt, both as an entry criterion for EMU and as a permanent provision for countries to stick to, once membership is granted. Violation of these restrictions might activate the so-called ‘Excessive Deficit Procedure’.The provisions for fiscal policy in the Treaty have failed to mitigate concerns about fiscal discipline in EMU. The reason is that, once countries have entered EMU, the Treaty provides only little scope for forcing fiscal discipline on the union participants. As a result, Germany, frightened by the possibility that undisciplined fiscal policies might undermine the common monetary policy, floated the idea of a ‘stability pact’.},

  abstract = {Debt sustainability is fundamentally a probabilistic concept: Debt is rarely sustainable with probability one. We propose an index of external debt sustainability that reflects this uncertainty. Namely we construct the index as the probability that, at the current exchange rate, net external debt is equal to or less than the present value of net exports. Constructing this index involves three steps: (1) deriving the distribution of the present value of net exports at the current exchange rate; (2) deriving the distribution of exchange rates associated with the condition that, for each realization, the present discounted value of net exports is at least equal to the value of current net debt; and (3) assessing where the current exchange rate stands in the distribution of exchange rates and thus the probability that debt is sustainable. Having shown how this can be done, we then compute the index for two countries, the United States and Chile. Our main conclusion is the large degree of uncertainty implied by the presence of large gross asset and liability positions, together with uncertainty about rates of return on these assets and liabilities. The size of the distribution of exchange rate adjustments implies that one should be careful in concluding that debt is or is not sustainable at the current exchange rate and that strong measures are potentially needed to reestablish sustainability. Exchange rates that appear overvalued in the baseline may still imply a reasonably high probability that debt is sustainable at the current exchange rate; symmetrically, exchange rates that appear undervalued in the baseline may still come with a reasonably low probability that debt is unsustainable at the current exchange rate.},

  abstract = {This lecture focuses on the costs of public debt when safe interest rates are low. I develop four main arguments. First, I show that the current US situation, in which safe  interest rates are expected to remain below growth rates for a long time, is more the historical norm than the exception. If the future is like the past, this implies that debt  rollovers, that is the issuance of debt without a later increase in taxes, may well be feasible. Put bluntly, public debt may have no fiscal cost. Second, even in the absence  of fiscal costs, public debt reduces capital accumulation, and may therefore have welfare costs. I show that welfare costs may be smaller than typically assumed. The  reason is that the safe rate is the risk-adjusted rate of return to capital. If it is lower than the growth rate, it indicates that the risk-adjusted rate of return to capital is in  fact low. The average risky rate however also plays a role. I show how both the average risky rate and the average safe rate determine welfare outcomes. Third, I look at  the evidence on the average risky rate, i.e., the average marginal product of capital. While the measured rate of earnings has been and is still quite high, the evidence  from asset markets suggests that the marginal product of capital may be lower, with the difference reflecting either mismeasurement of capital or rents. This matters for  debt: the lower the marginal product, the lower the welfare cost of debt. Fourth, I discuss a number of arguments against high public debt, and in particular the existence  of multiple equilibria where investors believe debt to be risky and, by requiring a risk premium, increase the fiscal burden and make debt effectively more risky. This is a  very relevant argument, but it does not have straightforward implications for the appropriate level of debt. My purpose in the lecture is not to argue for more public debt,  especially in the current political environment. It is to have a richer discussion of the costs of debt and of fiscal policy than is currently the case.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamic macroeconomic effects of public infrastructure investment under a balanced budget fiscal rule, using an overlapping generations model of a small open economy. The government finances public investment by employing distortionary labor taxes. The balanced budget rule implies a negative short-run output multiplier that exceeds (in absolute terms) the positive long-run output multiplier. Larger public capital spillovers sharpen the intertemporal output tradeoff. In contrast to conventional results regarding public investment shocks, we obtain dampened cyclical responses for plausible parameter values. The cyclical dynamics arise from the interaction between the labor tax rate, the tax base, and the intergenerational spillover effects. We show that financing scenarios involving public debt creation can substantially reduce the short-run output contraction and the transitional macroeconomic fluctuations induced by public investment.},

This note presents four counterexamples based on four versions of a simple OLG economy. In each version the growth rate exceeds the safe rate for one of four reasons – uninsured idiosyncratic risk, uninsured aggregate risk, policy uncertainty, and imperfect financial intermediation. Deficit finance does not directly address any of these problems. What works, respectively speaking, is progressive taxation, bilateral intergenerational risk-sharing, early policy resolution, and improved intermediation. The four examples thus show that seemingly free deficits may be more costly than they appear. Indeed, inefficient pay-go policy can even lower the government’s borrowing rate, encouraging yet more deficit finance.},

We develop a quantitative equilibrium theory of mortgage choice where households can choose from a menu of long-term (nominal) mortgage loans. The model accounts for observed patterns in housing consumption, ownership, and portfolio allocations. We find that the loan structure is a quantitatively significant factor in a household's housing finance decision. The model suggests that the mortgage structure preferred by a household is dependent on age and income and that loan products with low initial payments offer an alternative to mortgages with no downpayment. These effects are more important when inflation is low. The presence of inflation reduces the real value of the mortgage payment and the outstanding loan over time reducing mobility. Changes in the structure of mortgages have implications for risk sharing.},

Two major contributions are made to the existing literature of evaluating cycle synchronisation. First, instead of identifying turning points from individual macroeconomic timeseries, as carried out in most studies, this thesis obtains turning points from multivariate information. It is hoped that including more variables containing business cycle information in the dating process may produce more accurate turning points and, in turn, improve the accuracy of measuring cycle correlation. In doing so, both parametric and non-parametric business cycle dating procedures are used. These include the quarterly Bry–Boschan (BBQ) algorithm, a single dynamic factor model and the Markov switching dynamic factor model. Second, unlike the traditional approach that measures growth cycle synchronisation in the euro area by calculating pairwise cycle correlations, this thesis analyses the degree of growth cycle co-movement within a multivariate setting by using a VAR model with cointegration.

  abstract = {The fiscal theory says that the price level is determined by the ratio of nominal debt to the present value of real primary surpluses. I analyze long-term debt and optimal policy in the fiscal theory. I find that the maturity structure of the debt matters. For example, it determines whether news of future deficits implies current inflation or future inflation. When long-term debt is present, the government can trade current inflation for future inflation by debt operations; this tradeoff is not present if the government rolls over short-term debt. The maturity structure of outstanding debt acts as a "budget constraint" determining which periods' price levels the government can affect by debt variation alone. In addition, debt policy-the expected pattern of future state-contingent debt sales, repurchases and redemptions-matters crucially for the effects of a debt operation. I solve for optimal debt policies to minimize the variance of inflation. I find cases in which long-term debt helps to stabilize inflation. I also find that the optimal policy produces time series that are similar to U.S. surplus and debt time series. To understand the data, I must assume that debt policy offsets the inflationary impact of cyclical surplus shocks, rather than causing price level disturbances by policy-induced shocks. Shifting the objective from price level variance to inflation variance, the optimal policy produces much less volatile inflation at the cost of a unit root in the price level; this is consistent with the stabilization of U.S. inflation after the gold standard was abandoned.},

In Chapter 3 I expand on the context of the previous Chapter to examine the possibility of a central bank setting monetary policy with a present bias, and what this means for the economy as a whole. Finally, in Chapter 4 I investigate the empirical patterns of political pressure on central banks on a global level.

  abstract = {We use a rational expectations framework to assess the implications of rising debt in an environment with a "fiscal limit." The fiscal limit is defined as the point where the government no longer has the ability to finance higher debt levels by increasing taxes, so either an adjustment to fiscal spending or monetary policy must occur to stabilize debt. We give households a joint probability distribution over the various policy adjustments that may occur, as well as over the timing of when the fiscal limit is hit. One policy option that stabilizes debt is a passive monetary policy, which generates a burst of inflation that devalues the existing nominal debt stock. The probability of this outcome places upward pressure on inflation expectations and poses a substantial challenge to a central bank pursuing an inflation target. The distribution of outcomes for the path of future inflation has a fat right tail, revealing that only a small set of outcomes imply dire inflationary scenarios. Avoiding these scenarios, however, requires the fiscal authority to renege on some share of future promised transfers.},

  abstract = {The question of what is a sustainable public debt is paramount in the macroeconomic analysis of fiscal policy. This question is usually posed as asking whether the outstanding public debt and its projected path are consistent with those of the government's revenues and expenditures (i.e. whether fiscal solvency conditions hold). We identify critical flaws in the traditional approach to evaluate debt sustainability, and examine three alternative approaches that provide useful econometric and model-simulation tools to analyze debt sustainability. The first approach is Bohn's non-structural empirical framework based on a fiscal reaction function that characterizes the dynamics of sustainable debt and primary balances. The second is a structural approach based on a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium framework with a fully specified fiscal sector, which we use to quantify the positive and normative effects of fiscal policies aimed at restoring fiscal solvency in response to changes in debt. The third approach deviates from the others in assuming that governments cannot commit to repay their domestic debt, and can thus optimally decide to default even if debt is sustainable in terms of fiscal solvency. We use these three approaches to analyze debt sustainability in the United States and Europe after the recent surge in public debt following the 2008 crisis, and find that all three raise serious questions.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the effect of productive government spending (taxation) on aggregate savings behavior and its consequences for the dynamics of wealth inequality, taking into consideration key behavioral changes that occur during the process of economic development. Substantial empirical evidence suggests that during this process agents' preferences toward status (positional consumption) evolves according to the average wealth of the society. The sources of wealth include private capital and productive public capital, the latter financed by a distortionary income tax. This dynamic status effect impacts peoples' responses to tax policy in ways which contrast with those of the standard neoclassical model. Specifically, we find that in response to an increase in the income tax, in economies with a strong (weak) enough dynamic status effect, savings and inequality increase (decrease). Incorporating the behavioral changes to fiscal policy expands the set of mechanisms available to explain the observed variations of savings and wealth distribution dynamics that cannot be attributed to technological or other structural factors.},

We pursue three approaches to examine the sustainability. First, we calculate the minimum tax rate that stabilizes the debt to GDP ratio given the future government expenditures. Using 2010 as the base year, we find that the government revenue to GDP ratio must rise permanently to 40\%-47\% (from the current 33\%) to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio. Second, we estimate the response of the primary surplus when the debt to GDP ratio increases. We allow the relationship to fluctuate between two "regimes" using a Markov switching model. In both regimes, the primary surplus to GDP ratio fails to respond positively to debt, which suggests the process is explosive. Finally, we estimate a fiscal policy function and a monetary policy function with Markov switching. We find that the fiscal policy is "active" (the tax revenues do not rise when the debt increases) and the monetary policy is "passive" (the interest rate does not react to the inflation rate sufficiently) in both regimes. These results suggest that the current fiscal situation for the Japanese government is not sustainable.},

We show that a key difference among these regimes lies in the relative amount of exchange rate volatility that they entail. We also discuss a special case for which domestic inflation targeting constitutes the optimal policy, and where a simple second order approximation to the utility of the representative consumer can be derived and used to evaluate the welfare losses associated with the suboptimal rules.},

  abstract = {Is infrastructure construction an effective way to boost employment in distressed local labor markets? Using new geographically detailed data on highway construction that was funded bythe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, I study how road construction projects affect local employment growth. The method for allocating funds across space facilitates a plausible selection-on-observables strategy. I find that highway funding impacted construction employment at the county level: A dollar of additional Recovery Act spending on local construction increased local construction payrolls by thirty cents during the five years after the Act’s passage. The magnitude of this effect matches the national labor share of construction revenues, suggesting that targeted spending did not crowd out other local construction. These effects are most pronounced in counties with smaller populations and smaller shares of residents that commute to outside counties for work. However, when testing for general equilibrium effects on local employment and payroll aggregates, I find effects close to zero, with very wide confidence intervals across all specifications. Although the Recovery Act was an intervention significant enough to have a sizable impact on the construction sector in counties with low mobility, these findings suggest that the local variation in highway spending was too small relative to baseline regional volatility to detect a “local multiplier” effect impacting jobs outside of construction.},

The model replicates well the volatility and cyclicality of key macroeconomic variables observed in the past two decades in China. A host of shock decomposition exercises demonstrate that, among the shocks being considered, both financial and housing shocks are driving China's business cycles, accounting for a particularly large fraction of the variance in most macroeconomic and financial variables at the business cycle frequencies. In particular, the capital quality, housing demand, and loan-to-value shocks display prominent contributions to the business cycle fluctuations. Moreover, there exists substantial interactions between the banking and housing sectors in China, where the collateral constraint and the financial constraint amplify with each other. The results shed new light in the understanding of China's business cycles, and may serve as a useful benchmark for future quantitative analyses of China's macroeconomic fluctuations using DSGE frameworks.},

With joint support of monetary and fiscal policy, government infrastructure investment provides significant welfare gains to the economy, and the choice of fiscal instruments has major distributional effects across agents: saving households accrue the highest welfare gains with new bond issuance, while hand-to-mouth consumers are better off when non-distorting taxes are adjusted.

Public capital plays an important role in long-run growth through enhancing productivity and complementing the accumulation of private inputs. Under certain conditions, it could also have important implications for income inequality dynamics. Inequality is bad for growth, when the credit market is imperfect and there is a diminishing marginal rate of return on private investment. Certain public services and investment may benefit the poor more than proportionally and thus improve the distribution of income, and hence, improve economic growth through an indirect channel. The key mechanism linking the distribution of income to public capital is its disproportional effect on the economy that affects factor shares of capital. The paper also studies the determination of optimal tax.},

Households with the initial vectors falling in the upper side of the curve invest more in patience capital, which leads themselves to save more, and hence, the consumption level grows in the long run. Households with the initial vectors falling in the lower side opt out from investing in patience capital, leading to a decay of patience level, which leads themselves to save less and hence they perish in the long run.

  abstract = {This thesis examines the influence of local and regional governments in investment growth and productivity in Mexico. A combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis is used with the aim of assessing their influence and tools. Mexican municipalities and states have gained major participation in policy making, investment fostering and infrastructure building. The decentralised resources to meet these goals have increased considerably; as a consequence, it becomes imperative to measure the actual effects of such resources as well as to identify the opportunity areas to develop.  The first part of the empirical analysis, attempts to measure the influence of local governments’ expenditures on private investment growth, as well as to identify the most important investment drivers. Likewise, given the increasing foreign investments landing in Mexico, there is a potential regional competition between cities, this is also evaluated. A panel data analysis consistent with cross section dependence is carried out for 63 Metropolitan Areas (MA)/cities for the period 1993-2008. The econometric analysis shows that, municipal governments’ expenditures have had a substantial effect on private capital. In addition, competition strategies matters. More importantly, public infrastructure stock is revealed as a central determinant for investment, especially for manufacturing firms. The second empirical chapter evaluates whether municipal and state expenditures in economic policies have boosted productivity of firms. Firms and regional features are also included in the estimation models. Panel data analysis consistent to cross section dependence is used, for 63 MA/cities and 29 states. The results showed that the policies implemented in municipalities have had little or even negative effects over firms’ productivity. Meanwhile, the policies implemented by states have had larger influence on productivity increases.  In order to dig deeper into the role of local and regional governments in economic policies, two case studies –Hermosillo and Mexicali- are presented in the last part. Empirical models cannot tell about the local processes, as the data used is only expenditures. The fieldwork undertaken helped to identify the most significant policies followed in each city, as well as the leadership and organisation of stakeholders. The main finding suggests that local participation and overcoming political cycle is essential for the long-term success; and easing doing business for firms, rather than incentives, is more effective to spur private investment.},

To quantify the model, we measure distributions of house prices, house qualities, and mover characteristics from micro-data on San Diego County during the 2000s boom. The main result is that cheaper credit for poor households was a major driver of prices, especially at the low end of the market. (JEL D14, D91, R21, R31)},

Such policy prescriptions presuppose an ability to commit. Without that ability, the temptation to use inflation surprises to offset monopoly and tax distortions, as well as to reduce the real value of government debt, creates a state-dependent inflationary bias problem. High debt levels and short-term debt exacerbate the inflation bias. But this produces a debt stabilization bias because the policy maker wishes to deviate from the tax smoothing policies typically pursued under commitment, by returning government debt to steady-state. As a result, the response to shocks in New Keynesian models can be radically different, particularly when government debt levels are high and maturity short.},

This is unlikely to be the case in overlapping generations (OLG) economies, where the equilibrium interest rate may differ from the policy maker's rate of time preference. It may therefore be optimal to reduce debt today to reduce distortionary taxation in the future. In addition, the level of the capital stock in these economies is likely to be suboptimally low, and reducing government debt will crowd in additional capital. Using a version of the Blanchard-Yaari model of perpetual youth, with both public and private capital, we show that it is optimal in steady state for the government to hold assets. However, we also show how and why this level of government assets can fall short of both the level of debt that achieves the optimal capital stock and the level that eliminates income taxes. Finally, we compute the optimal adjustment path to this steady state.},

  abstract = {This dissertation can be thematically grouped into two categories: monetary theory in the so called New Monetarist search models where money and credit are essential in terms of improving social welfare, and optimal time-consistent monetary and fiscal policy in New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models when the government cannot commit. Arguably, the methodology and conceptual frameworks adopted in these two lines of work are quite different. However, they share a common goal in helping us understand how and why monetary factors can affect the real economy, and how monetary and fiscal policy should respond to developments in the economy to improve social welfare. There are two chapters in each part. In the first chapter, recent advances based on the pre-eminent Lagos-Wright (LW) monetary search model are reviewed. Against this background, chapter two introduces collateralized credit inspired by a communal responsibility system into the creditless LW model, in order to study the role of money and credit as alternative means of payment. In contrast, the third chapter revisits the classic inflation bias problem associated with optimal time-consistent monetary policy in the cashless New Keynesian framework. In this chapter, fiscal policy is trivial, due to the assumption of lump-sum tax. As a follow-up work, chapter four studies optimal time-consistent monetary and fiscal policy mix as well as debt maturity choice in an environment with only distortionary taxes, endogenous government spending and government debt of various maturities.  Chapter 1 introduces the tractable and influential Lagos-Wright (LW) search-theoretic framework and reviews the latest developments in extending it to study issues concerning the role of money, credit, asset pricing, monetary policy and economic growth. In addition, potential research topics are discussed. Our main message from this review is that the LW monetary model is flexible enough to deal with numerous issues where fiat money plays an essential role as a medium of exchange. Chapter 2, based on the LW framework, develops a search model of money and credit motivated by a historical medieval institution - the community responsibility system. The aim is to examine the role of credit collateralized by the community responsibility system as a supplementary medium of exchange in long-distance trade, assuming that entry cost and the cost of using credit are proportional to distance, due to factors like direct verification and settlement cost and indirect transportation cost. We find that both money and credit are useful in the sense of improving welfare. In addition, the Friedman rule can be sub-optimal in this economy, due to the interaction between the extensive margin (that is, the range of outside villages which the representative household has trade with) and the intensive margin (that is, the scope of villages where credit is used as a supplementary medium of exchange). Finally, higher entry cost narrows down the extensive margin, and similarly, higher cost of using credit, ceteris paribus, reduces the usage of credit and hence lowers social welfare.  Chapter 3 reconsiders the inflation bias problem associated with the renowned rules versus discretion debate in a fully nonlinear version of the benchmark New Keynesian DSGE model. We ask whether the inflation bias problem related to discretionary monetary policy differs quantitatively under two dominant forms of nominal rigidities - Calvo pricing and Rotemberg pricing, if the inherent nonlinearities are taken seriously. We find that the inflation bias problem under Calvo contracts is significantly greater than under Rotemberg pricing, despite the fact that the former typically exhibits far greater welfare costs of inflation. In addition, the rates of inflation observed under the discretionary policy are non-trivial and suggest that the model can comfortably generate the rates of inflation at which the problematic issues highlighted in the trend inflation literature. Finally, we consider the response to cost push shocks across both models and find these can also be significantly different. Thus, we conclude that the nonlinearities inherent in the New Keynesian DSGE model are empirically relevant and the form of nominal inertia adopted is not innocuous. Chapter 4 studies the optimal time-consistent monetary and fiscal policy when surprise inflation (or deflation) is costly, taxation is distortionary, and non-state-contingent nominal debt of various maturities exists. In particular, we study whether and how the change in nominal government debt maturity affects optimal policy mix and equilibrium outcomes, in the presence of distortionary taxes and sticky prices. We solve the fully nonlinear model using global solution techniques, and find that debt maturity has drastic effects on optimal time-consistent policies in New Keynesian models. In particular, some interesting nonlinear effects are uncovered. Firstly, the equilibrium value for debt is negative and close to zero, which implies a slight undershooting of the inflation target in steady state. Secondly, starting from high level of debt-GDP ratio, the optimal policy will gradually reduce the level of debt, but with radical changes in the policy mix along the transition path. At high debt levels, there is a reliance on a relaxation of monetary policy to reduce debt through an expansion in the tax base and reduced debt service costs, while tax rates are used to moderate the increases in inflation. However, as debt levels fall, the use of monetary policy in this way is diminished and the policy maker turns to fiscal policy to continue the reduction in debt. This is akin to a switch from an active to passive fiscal policy in rule based descriptions of policy, which occurs endogenously under the optimal policy as debt levels fall. It can also be accompanied by a switch from passive to active monetary policy. This switch in the policy mix occurs at higher debt levels, the longer the average maturity of government debt. This is largely because high debt levels induce an inflationary bias problem, as policy makers face the temptation to use surprise inflation to erode the real value of that debt. This temptation is then more acute when debt is of shorter maturity, since the inflationary effects of raising taxes to reduce debt become increasingly costly as debt levels rise. Finally, in contrast to the Ramsey literature with real bonds, in the current setting we find no extreme portfolios of short and long-term debt. In addition, optimal debt maturity, implicitly, lengthens with the level of debt.},

  abstract = {Research using structural models to identify monetary–fiscal interactions in emerging economies is still rare. However, it has long been emphasized that monetary and fiscal policies jointly determine macroeconomic dynamics. Using data from China over the period 1993–2017, we estimate the policy regime and shed light on the role of policy shocks in shaping the business cycles in the largest emerging economy. The estimation strongly prefers a passive monetary coupled with an active fiscal policy regime (PM/AF). As confirmed using Chinese data, the transmission mechanisms under this fiscal dominance regime are completely different from those under the commonly assumed AM/PF regime. Moreover, unlike monetary policy shocks, fiscal policy shocks substantially affect inflation and output growth variations in both short- and long-run under PM/AF. Our analysis highlights the importance of scrutinizing the prevailing monetary–fiscal policy regime in understanding macroeconomic dynamics, particularly in emerging economies, which have been largely understudied.},

It is shown that the monetarist hypothesis is invalid if the deficit is defined exclusive of interest payments, but that it is valid under the conventional definition. It is also shown that the stock of bonds can grow indefinitely at a rate in excess of the rate of output growth, provided that the difference is less than the rate of time preference. These formal conclusions do not take account of possible limitations on taxing capacity arising from default incentives that tend to grow with the stock of bonds.},

Key to this mechanism is that policies are implemented under discretion. The government's discretionary incentive to erode the real value of nominal public debt by means of surprise inflation renders inflation expectations and, in further consequence, equilibrium inflation rates highly correlated with the stock of public debt. Debt, in turn, is highly persistent, allowing for tax-smoothing in the face of disturbances. Due to the aforementioned correlation, the persistence in debt carries over to inflation. Our analysis uncovers a non-monotonic effect of nominal rigidities on inflation persistence and shows that government debt under discretion does not display the near random walk property familiar from the Ramsey literature. A calibrated version of the model that incorporates a moderate degree of monopolistic competition and price stickiness is quantitatively consistent with the inflation dynamics experienced in the USA since the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s.},

Greater social diffusion of information makes this knowledge more widespread among voters. As a result, we find it alleviates myopic political incentives to underinvest in human capital, and it helps the selection of politicians that ensure high productivity in public education. Through this mechanism, we show that social capital raises the equilibrium growth rate of output and reduces its volatility. We provide evidence consistent with the predictions of our model. Individuals with higher social capital are more informed about their government. Countries with higher social capital spend a higher share of output on public education.},

In particular, it proposes to construct Laffer Curves via policy experiments where fiscal policy is set optimally and fiscal instruments are jointly varied along the transition to steady-state. This relation is labelled as an ‘optimal Laffer curve’. It is shown that the tax revenue and welfare gains relative to the ‘quasi-static’ policy experiments examined by the previous literature are dramatic. The second and the third chapters are instead dedicated to developing and estimating a DSGE model of the Scottish economy and the rest of the UK. The second chapter reviews the literature of DSGE models developed in academia and central banks in recent years, and outlines our model. In the third chapter, the model is then estimated and its quantitative implications are explored.},

  abstract = {In non-monetary neo-classical growth models, the equilibrium degree of capital intensity and correspondingly the equilibrium marginal productivity of capital and rate of interest are determined by "productivity and thrift," i.e., by technology and saving behavior. Keynesian difficulties, associated with divergence between warranted and natural rates of growth, arise when capital intensity is limited by the unwillingness of investors to acquire capital at unattractively low rates of return. But why should the community wish to save when rates of return are too unattractive to invest? This can be rationalized only if there are stores of value other than capital, with whose rates of retrun the marginal productivity of capital must compete. The paper considers monetary debt of the government as one alternative store of value and shows how enough saving may be channeled into this form to bring the warranted rate of growth of capital down to the natural rate. Equilibrium capital intensity and interest rates are then determined by portfolio behavior and monetary factors as well as by saving behavior and technology. In such an equilibrium, the real monetary debt grows at the natural rate also, either by deficit spending or by deflation. The stability of the equilibrium is also considered.},

We assume that public investment is fully financed by fiscal deficit in our model analyzing the effects of public debt on the economy. Our results under the fiscal rule can be summarized as follows. First, the model shows two steady states exist: one is unstable with zero growth and the other is saddle-path stable with positive growth. The economy may not converge to the stable steady state if the public capital relative to public debt is not sufficient at the initial point. Second, the model shows that the growth maximizing tax rate exceeds the welfare-maximizing tax rate in considering transitional dynamics, but the short-term effect can differ from that of a model with a balanced budget rule.},

  abstract = {This thesis is composed of three core chapters on modern dynamic macroeconomics, which study different aspects of the public sector labor market in a large EU economy with significant public employment share and a non-trivial public sector wage premium over the private sector labor compensation. The study in this dissertation adds to earlier research by incorporating endogenous government hours and wages in the model framework and argues that the presence of a sizable public sector labor market in European economies generates significant interaction with the private sector labor and capital markets. In addition, the presence of interest groups (labor unions, government bureaucracy), as well as other labor market frictions in the public sector, is shown to be an important element of the analysis when discussing fiscal policy reforms. Motivated by the highly-unionized public sectors, the high public shares in total employment, and the public sector wage premia observed in most post-WWII European economies, Chapter 1 examines the role of public sector unions in a general equilibrium framework. A strong union presence in a large non-market sector is shown to be relevant for both business cycle  fluctuations and for the welfare effect of fiscal regime changes. To this end, an otherwise standard real-business-cycle (RBC) model is augmented with a public sector union optimization problem. The resulting theoretical setup generates cyclical behavior in government hours and wages that is consistent with data behavior in an economy with a highly-unionized public sector, namely Germany during the period 1970-2007. The main findings of Chapter 1 are: (i) the model with a public sector union performs reasonably well vis-a-vis data; (ii) overall, the public sector union model is a significant improvement over a similar model with exogenous public sector employment; (iii) endogenously-determined public wage and hours add to the distortionary effect of contractionary tax reforms and produce significantly higher welfare losses. Additionally, the union model requires greater changes in tax rates to achieve a pre-specified increase in tax revenue compared to an equivalent model with exogenous public sector hours. Thus, endogenous public sector hours and wages in the setup are shown to be quantitatively important for public policy evaluation. Ignoring the positive co-movement between public and private hours and wages leads to a significant underestimation of the welfare effect of fiscal regime changes. Chapter 2 characterizes optimal fiscal policy and evaluates it relative to the exogenous (observed) one. Motivated by the high public employment, and the public wage premia observed in the major European economies, a Real-Business-Cycle model, calibrated to German data (1970-2007), is set up with a richer government spending side, and an endogenous private-public sector labor choice. To illustrate the effects of fiscal policy on sectoral allocation of hours, public wage rate determination and the provision of labor-intensive public services, two regimes are compared and contrasted to one another - exogenous vs. optimal (Ramsey) policy case. The main findings from the computational experiments performed in Chapter 2 are: (i) The optimal steady-state capital tax rate is zero, as it is the most distortionary tax to use; (ii) A higher labor tax rate is needed in the Ramsey case to compensate for the loss in capital tax revenue; (iii) Under the optimal policy regime, public sector employment is lower, but government employees receive higher wages; (iv) The benevolent Ramsey planner provides the optimal amount of the public good, and substitutes labor for capital in the input mix for public services and private output; (v) The government wage bill is smaller, while public investment is three times higher than in the exogenous policy case. Lastly, the thesis tries to delve into the hierarchical structure of public employment service and addresses the problem of rent-seeking in the public sector by government bureaucrats. Chapter 3 studies the wasteful effect of bureaucracy on the economy by addressing the link between rent-seeking behavior of government bureaucrats and the public sector wage bill, which is taken to represent the rent component. In particular, public officials are modeled as individuals competing for a larger share of those public funds. The theoretical model used is calibrated to German data for the period 1970-2007. The analysis then extends to the other major EU economies as well. To illustrate the effects of fiscal policy on rent-seeking, the exogenous and the optimal (Ramsey) policy cases are compared and contrasted to one another. The main findings of Chapter 3 are: (i) Due to the existence of a signicant public sector wage premium and the large public sector employment, a substantial amount of working time is spent rent-seeking, which in turn leads to significant losses measured in terms of aggregate output; (ii) The measures for the rent-seeking cost obtained from the model for the major EU countries are highly-correlated to indices of bureaucratic ineficiency; (iii) Under the optimal fiscal policy regime, steady-state rent-seeking is smaller relative to the exogenous policy case. The benevolent government invests more in public capital, sets a higher public wage premium, but chooses much lower public employment, thus achieving a decrease in rent-seeking.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a general equilibrium model to study the link between the amount of capital invested in housing assets and the term structure of interest rates. In the model, the production of housing assets is irreversible and housing assets can be used as collateral for borrowing funds. Agents’ decisions about consumption and investments in housing and non-housing assets generate a time-varying market price of risk that drives the dynamics of the term structure. The calibration to U.S. data using the simulated method of moments technique captures the dynamics of consumption, and the short- and long-term interest rates.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the price level remains determinate even in the case of two kinds of radical money supply endogeneity - an interest rate peg by the central bank, and a “free banking” regime - that are commonly supposed to imply loss of control of the price level. Price level determination under such regimes can be understood in terms of a “fiscal theory of the price level,” according to which the equilibrium price level is that level that makes the real value of nominally denominated government liabilities equal to the present value of expected future government budget surpluses.},
